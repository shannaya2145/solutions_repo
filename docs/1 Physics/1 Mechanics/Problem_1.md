# Problem 1
### **Projectile Motion Notes**

**Definition:**
Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown into the air, influenced by gravity, with both horizontal and vertical motion components.

**Key Characteristics:**
1. **Two Motion Components**:
   - **Horizontal motion**: Constant velocity (no acceleration).
   - **Vertical motion**: Accelerated motion due to gravity (9.8 m/s² downward).

2. **Trajectory**: The path followed by the object is a **parabola**.

**Important Terms**:
1. **Initial velocity (u)**: The speed and direction at which the object is launched.
2. **Launch angle (θ)**: The angle at which the object is launched relative to the horizontal.
3. **Time of flight (T)**: Total time the object is in the air.
4. **Maximum height (H)**: Highest point reached by the object.
5. **Range (R)**: The horizontal distance the object travels before hitting the ground.

**Equations** (assuming no air resistance):
1. **Horizontal motion**:
   - \( x = u_x \cdot t \) (where \( u_x \) is horizontal velocity).
2. **Vertical motion**:
   - \( y = u_y \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \) (where \( u_y \) is the vertical component of initial velocity, and \( g \) is acceleration due to gravity).

**Key Concepts**:
- **Horizontal velocity**: \( u_x = u \cdot \cos(\theta) \).
- **Vertical velocity**: \( u_y = u \cdot \sin(\theta) \).

**Maximum Height**: 
\[ H = \frac{u_y^2}{2g} \]

**Range**:
\[ R = \frac{u^2 \cdot \sin(2\theta)}{g} \]

**Example Problems**: 
Use the equations to calculate time of flight, maximum height, and range based on initial velocity and launch angle.
